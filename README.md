# Shopping Cart
Shopping cart application created using C++ and Qt framework

## About
This application creates a shopping cart window which can be populated by a list of items and their associated prices (in this case for a pet store). Users can add and remove items as well as bundles. The checkout button shows the users total price and order summary in a seperate window.
